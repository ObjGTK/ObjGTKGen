ObjGTKGen
==========

ObjGTKGen is a utility that generates Objective-C language bindings for ObjGTK using GObject Introspection (parsing GIR files). ObjGTKGen is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL.

ObjGTK is the GTK+-3.0 framework for ObjFW based on [ObjFW](https://objfw.nil.im/) by Jonathan Schleifer and [CoreGTK](https://github.com/coregtk)(Gen) by Tyler Burton.

The ObjGTK code base is compatible with the Objective C dialect of GCC ("Objective C 2.0") as introduced as of Mac OS X 10.5. So there is no need to use clang. There are plans to create a branch that delivers advanced support of clang language features, especially memory management via Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

ObjGTK is not yet released. Take a look at the [milestones](https://codeberg.org/Letterus/objgtkgen/milestones) for a release plan.
